## Step05_Learning_CNN_artificial_neural_network
### Train an CNN artificial neural network using collected data

#### 01 Convert image to numpy array
#### 02 Divide the data set 8:2 into training data and testing data
#### 03 Construct CNN artificial neural network and perform learning
#### 04 Save the learned CNN artificial neural network model as model.h5
#### 05 model.h5 is used for autonomous driving


## Photos related to the project
#### After learning is completed, 4 photos are randomly selected and displayed on the screen
