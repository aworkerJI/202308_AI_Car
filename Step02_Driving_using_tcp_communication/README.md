### PI and PC communicate with TCP socket
### PC receives real-time video and infrared sensor input from PI
### Transfer data from PC to PI for motor control
###
#### Set PI as the socket communication server
####  01 Transmission to PC of infrared sensor values and camera data
####  02 Running a thread with data received from a PC
####
#### Set PC as the socket communication client
#### Output the image data received from Pi on the PC screen
#### and transmit the motor operation data to PI.
####  01 Receive sensor value and video data
